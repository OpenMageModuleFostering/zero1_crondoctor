    <p>This extension allows you to see all required information for the essential Cron system which runs all Magentos
        scheduled tasks. Often there can be failures with code or processes, timeouts, memory errors or issues with
        third-party modules causing the Cron system to block up. </p>

    <h2>Misc</h2>
    <h3>Stopping/Starting Cron after installation</h3>
    If you need to stop cron, from the root of your magento installation:<br/>
    <pre>touch zero1/cron_stop.flag</pre><br/>
    <pre>watch -n1 "ps aux | grep cron.php | grep -v grep"</pre><br/>
    wait until all jobs are finished.<br/>
    To restart cron:<br/>
    <pre>rm zero1/cron_stop.flag</pre><br/>
    you should then be able to see all jobs restarting
    <hr/>
    <h3>Disaster Recover</h3>
    If cron is stopped with the cron_stop.flag being in place, then you could end up with jobs the are permanently running.
    This can be observed by going to System > Cron Doctor and checking filtering by status = 'running' if there are more than 2 jobs running there is an issue.
    <br/>
    <b>enterprise_refresh_index</b>: is an 'always' job, if this job hasn't ran since cron has been started again i.e status == running and executed_at is before cron was stopped, the status of this job will need changing (to anything but 'running')
    <br/>
    Every other job is the same principle as enterprise_refresh_index.

    N.B you should expect 0 - 2 jobs running at anyone time if there are 2 jobs running 1 of them should be enterprise_refresh_index, if this is not the case there is an issue.
